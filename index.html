    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is the role of AI in the RENT platform?</h3>
        <p>AI in our platform helps with dynamic pricing, ensuring fair and market-driven rental prices for NFTs. It also monitors for fraud and enhances user experience through personalized recommendations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does AI affect NFT pricing?</h3>
        <p>Our AI-based system continuously analyzes market trends, NFT rarity, and demand to adjust rental prices automatically. This ensures the fairest price for renters and the highest earnings for NFT owners.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Will AI help prevent fraud on the platform?</h3>
        <p>Yes! AI monitors user behavior and transaction patterns to detect any suspicious activity, preventing fraud and ensuring that NFTs are securely returned to their owners after rentals.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What happens to RENT tokens when I rent an NFT?</h3>
        <p>When you rent an NFT, the **RENT tokens** used for the rental are **burned** to reduce supply. This helps to create scarcity and increase the value of the remaining **RENT tokens**.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do owners get rewarded?</h3>
        <p>When a user rents their NFT, the owner receives **SOL** as a reward, which is deposited directly into their wallet.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How can I earn more RENT tokens?</h3>
        <p>You can stake **RENT tokens** to earn rewards in the form of more **RENT tokens**. The rewards are generated from transaction fees and NFT rental fees, with the APY varying based on platform activity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does the RENT token burning mechanism work?</h3>
        <p>
            When you rent an NFT using RENT tokens, 100% of the tokens used for the rental will be burned initially. Over time, this percentage will gradually decrease:
            
                After 6 months, 80% of the RENT tokens used will be burned.
                After another 6 months, 70% of the RENT tokens will be burned.
                After 12 months, 50% of the RENT tokens will be burned.
            
            This system ensures that the RENT token supply will be reduced over time, providing scarcity and increasing value for holders.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I rent an NFT using RENT tokens?</h3>
        <p>
            To rent an NFT, simply browse through the marketplace and select the NFT you'd like to rent. Use RENT tokens to pay for the rental. Upon successful payment, the RENT tokens will be burned, and the owner of the NFT will receive SOL as a reward. The rented NFT will be locked to your wallet for the duration of the rental period and automatically returned to the owner once the rental ends.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What rewards do I get if I stake RENT tokens?</h3>
        <p>
            By staking RENT tokens, you can earn passive rewards in the form of additional RENT tokens. The rewards come from transaction fees and NFT rental fees on the platform. You'll earn around 5% annual percentage yield (APY), but this can vary depending on the volume of transactions and rentals. The more activity there is on the platform, the more rewards you can earn.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I start renting out my NFTs?</h3>
        <p>
            To rent out your NFTs, simply list them on the RENT platform. Once listed, users will be able to browse and rent your NFTs using RENT tokens. When they rent your NFT, you will receive SOL as a reward, and the RENT tokens used for the rental will be burned. Your NFT will be locked to their wallet until the rental period ends, at which point it will automatically be returned to you.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does the staking system work?</h3>
        <p>
            When you stake RENT tokens, you're essentially locking them up to help secure the platform and participate in governance decisions. In return, you earn additional RENT tokens as rewards. The amount of rewards you receive depends on transaction fees and NFT rental fees, with an expected 5% APY. This APY will fluctuate based on the total transaction volume and staking activity on the platform.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What are the benefits of holding RENT tokens?</h3>
        <p>
            Holding RENT tokens allows you to:
            
                Rent NFTs for use in games and virtual worlds.</li>
                Earn passive rewards by staking your RENT tokens.</li>
                Vote on platform governance decisions, helping to shape the future of RENT.</li>
                Participate in a deflationary system where tokens are burned over time, creating scarcity and potentially increasing the value of your holdings.</li>
